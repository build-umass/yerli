# Yerli Web App

## Guide for setting up the Yerli GitHub on Windows: 
(Should be almost ***identical for mac, just use Terminal*** instead of cmd)

  1. If not installed already, install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
  2. In any directory, in cmd run
```sh
    $ yarn global add expo-cli
```
3. Once that is complete, clone this GitHub repo and put it in the directory you want
4. In cmd navigate to the yerli folder using cd
5. Run the below command to install the rest of the dependencies
```sh
    $ yarn install
```
6. After that completes, running the below command should open the expo developer tools in your browser, which will likely be at http://localhost:19002/ (the terminal would state it)
```sh
    $ yarn start
```
7. Click 'Run in web browser' to see the app online or download the Expo app (needs an account but lets you see it on your iPhone which is recommended).


## If anyone needs help or if I messed up one of the steps which is totally possible let me know! Any specific questions on using the Expo app I can also help :) -> Bryce
